#Product vision: "To enhance the quality of the multiplayer gaming experience and player satisfaction by matchmaking players
that not only share similar skill levels but also personal preferences and positive personality traits with the use of 
skill levels and behavior based ranking and matchmaking system."

#Product Backlog Ordering: We have ordered the product backlog in based on how we have agreed upon as a team the needs to 
build the overall software system. It begins by completing the environment setups for development and from there, it flows 
into creating the home screen and prioritizing the matchmaking process. The main focus of this project is to provide a 
solution to better matchmaking, so that is what we plan to resolve first. Within the backlog are stories that we feel have 
less priority, however, also give our system the functionality it needs to provide a complete solution.

#Definition of Ready: In order to consider a user story ready for development, it must meet our criteria. 
This includes: Descriptive Title, Description with Use Case, Acceptance Criteria, Story Points
